# ClientServerRESTimpl
Console project, which emulate the client-server technology with RESTfull api methodology.

This program should be work as a standalone program. In the /dist directory we have a .jar and .bat executable files,
both of them be able to execute for looking at program working result ( i prefer the .bat file ). In addition, the project
has a some test scripts created by JUnit framework.
